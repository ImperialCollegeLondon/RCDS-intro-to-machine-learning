# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a broad topic, with a wide range of applications in scientific research. 

In this series of lectures, we will look at the fundamental concepts of unsupervised and supervised learning, including the training, testing and evaluation of models for classification and regression.  We also explore the basic theory of neural networks and discuss their applications to deep learning.

Examples will be provided using the Orange data science environment.  No programming experience is required.


## Learning outcomes

After attending this workshop, you will be better able to:

* Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
* Select a suitable machine learning method for a given application.
* Prepare your own training and testing data sets.
* Evaluate the performance of a machine learning experiment.


## Installing Orange 3

Please ensure that you have Orange 3 installed and working before the first session.

The Anaconda data science platform includes Orange 3, and may be the easiest way to install: https://www.anaconda.com/ .

Alternatively, you can install Orange 3 from https://orange.biolab.si/download .

To check that everything is working properly, please follow the steps in this first tutorial video:
